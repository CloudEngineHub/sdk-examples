# Spectacular AI mapping tools

This page has instructions for post-processing data recorded through the Spectacular AI SDK on supported devices, exporting to Nerfstudio, training NeRFs and 3DGS, and visualizing the process. The Spectacular AI mapping tool (`sai-cli process`) is powered by the Spectacular AI _Mapping API_ 
([documentation](https://spectacularai.github.io/docs/sdk/python/latest/#module-spectacularAI.mapping)).

## Installation

These instructions assume you want to train NeRFs or 3DGS using Nerfstudio. For other uses, Nerfstudio and CUDA are not required, but you simply need Python, `pip` and FFmpeg.

 1. [install Nerfstudio](https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/nerfstudio#1-installation-setup-the-environment) (**Requirement**: a good NVidia GPU + CUDA).
 2. Install FFmpeg. Linux `apt install ffmpeg` (or similar, if using another package manager). Windows: [see here](https://www.editframe.com/guides/how-to-install-and-start-using-ffmpeg-in-under-10-minutes). FFmpeg must be in your `PATH` so that `ffmpeg` works on the command line.
 3. In Nerfstudio's Conda environment, install the Spectacular AI Python library with all recommended dependencies:

        pip install spectacularAI[full]

## Recording data

Choose your device below to see more detailed instructions for creating Spectacular AI recordings (folders or zip files):

<details><summary><b>iPhone</b> (with or without LiDAR)</summary><p>
   
 1. Download [Spectacular Rec](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spectacular-rec/id6473188128) from App Store.
 2. See our [instruction video on YouTube](https://youtu.be/d77u-E96VVw) on how to create recording files and transfer them to your computer.

</p></details>

<details><summary><b>OAK-D</b></summary><p>

 1. Plug in the OAK-D to your laptop (or directly the computer with the heavy GPU)
 2. Run `sai-cli record oak --no_feature_tracker --resolution=800p`.

If the above settings cause issues, try running `sai-cli record oak` instead. Coming soon: ðŸŒˆ colors.

With OAK-D or RealSense devices, you can currently expect to be able to map "table-sized" scenes
quite fast and accurately. Move slow while mapping and shoot from different angles to increase quality.

## Nerfstudio export and training

First run our conversion script and then Nerstudio training as

    sai-cli process INPUT_PATH --preview3d --key_frame_distance=0.05 /example/output/path/my-nerf
    ns-train nerfacto --data /example/output/path/my-nerf

Where

 * `INPUT_PATH` is the dataset folder recorded using _Spectacular Rec_ or our other recording tools (the value of `recordingFolder` if using the SDK directly)
 * `/example/output/path/my-nerf` (placeholder) is the output folder of this script and the input to Nerfstudio
 * `--key_frame_distance` should be set based on the recorded scene size: `0.05` (5cm) is good for small scans and `0.15` for room-sized scans.
 * `--preview3d` (optional flag) shows you a 3D preview of the point cloud and estimated trajectory (not the final ones).

If the processing gets slow, you can also try adding a `--fast` flag to `sai-cli process` to trade off quality for speed.
Without the `--fast` flag, the processing should take around 10 minutes tops.

### Gaussian Splatting

**2023-11-14**. Currently supports the Nerfstudio [branch](https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/nerfstudio/pull/2521) powered by [gsplat](https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/gsplat).
Installation instructions: 

 1. Create and activate a Conda environment for Nerfstudio (see [instructions](https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/nerfstudio#create-environment))
 2. Install _gsplat_ to the same Conda environment:
    
        git clone https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/gsplat
        cd gsplat
        pip install -e .
    
 4. Install the `gaussian-splatting` branch of Nerfstudio:
    
        git clone https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/nerfstudio.git
        cd nerfstudio
        git checkout gaussian-splatting  # <--- Different from standard instructions
        pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
        pip install -e .

 5. Train as `ns-train gaussian-splatting --data /example/output/path/my-nerf`

## Export to other tools

The data can also be exported to 

 * Nvidia Instant NGP: see [replay_to_instant_ngp.py](./replay_to_instant_ngp.py)
 * https://github.com/wanmeihuali/taichi_3d_gaussian_splatting (use `sai-cli process --format=taichi ...`)
 * Other tools that use a similar COLMAP-like folder structure than Nerfstudio (`sai-cli process` default output format)

The export process can also be customized by modifying the source code of [`sai-cli process`](https://github.com/SpectacularAI/sdk/blob/main/python/cli/process/process.py)
which can also be used as a standalone Python script.

## Recording data format

The recording format created by the SDK and Spectacular Rec is [documented here](https://github.com/SpectacularAI/vio_benchmark/blob/main/DATA_FORMAT.md),
and can also be used for other purposes. It is based on encoded videos and JSONL, making it a convinient and effective choice for high-resolution, high-frequency multi-camera, multi-sensor data.
In particular, we can efficiently and economically store

 * Multi-camera RGB or monochrome data
 * Depth data (via PNGs or FFV1)
 * IMU, synchronized with the camera frames
 * Other sensors, e.g., barometer or GPS
